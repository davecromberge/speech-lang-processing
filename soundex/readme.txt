Soundex v1.0 Readme
===================

To run the program, from the command line type:

> java -jar soundex.jar <path_to_surnames.txt>

where surnames.txt is a text file containing lines of surnames separated by spaces.

For example, if surnames.txt was located in the home directory:

> java -jar soundex.jar /home/dave/surnames.txt


The program will then produce soundex output for each line of text on the console.
